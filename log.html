<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-08-02 - 13:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">This will be the final update, hopefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-07-03 - 18:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Added my PAYDAY 2 mod folders under modlists page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-07-02 - 16:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">In the process of making a PAYDAY 2 mod, we'll see if it fully comes through but it's weapon tweaks mainly, with a file to make your own, should you feel the need to. I forgot to update the log before but I added an IWAD section, they've been uploaded all over Github, but this one just has a fancy download button for all of them in a .7z file.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-18 - 02:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Removed support discord server and in turn the link for it, no need for it really. Cleaned up the code on this page. Just a quick edit, nothing much else. I did make a new mod that I might upload, however it uses another author's assets. I also might upload some of my old mods, if I can find them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-05 - 10:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Removed opening on new window, just use CTRL/CMD. Also added link for new support Discord server, hopefully <em>they</em> don't join but I don't think they care about me anymore, thank god. Currently the Discord server just has support for the currently maintained JOURNEY modlist and any mods I release. Doubt anyone will join but who knows. Might add more spacing to this page, but I like the compactness of it. Probably won't add much for a while except for fixes on this website unless I find a new project to work on, so this is me signing off for now. Log probably won't be updated in accordance to fixes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 17:30]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Added more to the about me page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 17:20]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">I really gotta add a logo/branding image for CoTOZ, even if I don't support it the two titles are <u>really annoying me</u>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 17:15]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Typo fix on this page, man do I suck at typing and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 17:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Added my old 7 Days to Die mods and did some grammar touchups around the website, less lowercase now, also fixed a typo where it labelled the "(change)log" link as the "contact" link. Also added a "src" button for those that are curious, it wasn't hard to find before but now it's right in your face, so that's cool I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 16:40]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Fixed up this page and deleted "yert" repository, hasta la vista, baby...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 16:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Deleted lowercasettw modlist, I don't use it anymore and it's better off just to use Wasteland Survival Guide and turn off the mods you don't want to use. Also updated JOURNEY with animation replacements for cigaretts, much quicker now. Cleaned up some of the website code and deleted repositories that I didn't find useful anymore. "yert" repository might be deleted next... Fuck those guys.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><b>[2022-06-04 - 12:00]</b></span><br /><span style="color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Welcome to the (change)log. Thoughts and updates central.</span></p>

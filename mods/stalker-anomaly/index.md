My S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly mods.

#### [Classic Actor](./dl/classic-actor/) 
A collection of DLTX files that make healing, bleeds, drops, and stamina more like the trilogy. Recommended to pair with Less Items for a "true trilogy experience".
```
mod_death_generic_more_ammo_drops.ltx: More ammo dropped per death.
mod_system_classic_bleeds.ltx: Changes the bleed values to Shadow of Chernobyl's.
mod_system_classic_healing.ltx: Changes the medkit healing values to Old World Addon's.
mod_system_classic_stamina_regen_while_walking: Changes the stamina use values to be more like Shadow of Chernobyl/Clear Sky and also allow it to regenerate while walking.
```

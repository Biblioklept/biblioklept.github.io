My 7 Days To Die mods.

#### [No Grass](./dl/NoGrass.7z)
Removes grass entirely from the game. Makes it harder to get plant fibres, I recommend the Less Grass mod over this.

#### [Less Grass](./dl/LessGrass.7z)
Reduces the amount of grass spawned.

#### [Static XP](./dl/StaticXP.7z) 
Makes XP level up point static.

;    Make sure this file is in your data/ini/ folder.
;
;    Anything that starts with a ; in this ini is a comment and 
;    is ignored by the game. Lines that start with "setgs"
;    or "set LDQuest" can be edited. Also, if a feature is
;    disabled, then the rest of the settings for that
;    particular feature will have no effect and can be ignored.
;
;   - Set whether to use GMST edits to equalize overall movement speeds.
;     Minimum speed will be higher, athletics will have minimal impact
;     on movement speed.
;
;     The last two values reduce creature speed to a level that
;     (in my opinion) is a bit more realistic for them.
;
;     Remove the ; in front of the changes made below if you
;     wish to enable them.
;
;     You can also edit the values below to your liking and use them
;     instead of other speed-altering mods to save an esp slot.
;
;	setgs fMoveCharWalkMin 130.000000
;	setgs fMoveCharWalkMax 140.000000
;	setgs fMoveRunAthleticsMult 0.100000
;	setgs fMoveRunMult 2.3
;	setgs fMoveCreatureWalkMin 50.000000
;	setgs fMoveCreatureWalkMax 130.000000
;
;    - The settings below will fix the third person camera
;     so it always instantly follows the player. 
;
	setgs fChase3rdPersonXYMult 50.000000
	setgs fChase3rdPersonVanityXYMult 99.000000
;
;    - The values below change combat-related game settings
;      to increase damage taken and damage dealt. The values are
;      similar to OOO's damage/health multipliers.
;
;      The changes are disabled by default. Uncomment them below
;      to enable them. (remove the ; in front of setgs)
;
;    - Damage multipliers
;
;	setgs fDamageWeaponMult 1.25
;	setgs fCreatureCalcDamage 1.35
;
;    - Enemy health multipliers
;
;	setgs fNPCAttributeHealthMult 0.5

;
;    - Damage to armor/weapons
;	
;	setgs fDamageToArmorPercentage to 3
;	setgs fDamageToWeaponPercentage to 0.03
;
;   - Misc. game settings (Health bars will display for a little
;     bit longer and enemies will keep their weapons in their
;     inventory on death instead of dropping them)
;
;     If iDeathDropWeaponChance is set to 0 then other mods that
;     make enemies keep their weapons in their inventory on death
;     are no longer needed.
;
;	setgs fEnemyHealthBarTimer 5
;	setgs iDeathDropWeaponChance 0
;
;   - The settings below disable the knockback when an actor is hit.
;     Enabled by default.
;
	setgs fknockbackDamageBase 0
	setgs fknockbackTime 0	
;
;   - The setting below will decrease the combat hit cone angle
;     and make it easier to dodge attacks by side-stepping.
;
;     Note that reducing this makes Cleaving harder.
;
;	setgs fCombatHitConeAngle 25
;
;==========================================================================
;
; 1. DODGE
;
; - Set whether to enable dodging for the player. 
;
;   The player will be invincible for 0.3 sec while dashing.
;   i-frames are increased to 0.75 sec while rolling.
;
;   Compatible with my Interact Animations mod.
;   As in, you can't dodge while eating/drinking/looting etc.
;
;   Note: Please keep this enabled. This starts the main quest
;   of the mod that a bunch of other features depend on.
;   I recommend just setting the dodge requirement to 99 or 
;   something if you don't want to make use of this feature.
;
;   But keep it enabled or things will break!
;
;   (0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled)
;

;
; - Set whether to also enable Dodging by double-tapping a direction key.
;   Note: you can only Backstep with the dodge key.
;

;
;   Note: dash into roll will only work with the Dodge key. Dodging by
;   double-tapping will cause you to dash by default. This behavior
;   can be changed further below in this section.
;
	set LDQuest.DoubleTapDodge to 0		;default 0 (off)
;

	set LDQuest.DodgeCDTimer to 3		;default 3 (3 sec)
;
; - Set whether to use the old code for Dodge initialization.
;
;   Fixes the misaligned camera if using Enhanced Camera,

;   a single time for it to start working.
;
;   Temporary fix until I can figure out how to get this mod
;   to play nice with Enhanced Camera.
;
	set LDQuest.DodgeECcomp to 0		;default 0
;
; - Pressing the Dodge key will cause you to dash by default. 
;   Pressing the key again while dashing will cause you to roll-dodge.
;
;   This behavior can be changed below.
;
;	set to 0 for default behavior (dash into roll),
;	set to 1 to only enable rolling,
;	set to 2 to only enable dashing
;	set to 3 to use separate keys for dashing/rolling
;
	set LDQuest.DodgeBehavior to 0		;default 0

;	set to 0 for default behavior (0.35 sec/ 0.75 sec)
;	set to 1 for 0.35 sec
;	set to 2 for 0.75 sec
;
;   Can be mixed and matched with the dodge behavior options,
;   though you should probably keep this at 0 if using the default
;   dash into roll behavior.
;
	set LDQuest.iframes to 0		;default 0
;
; - Set whether to obscure/fade the player while dashing or dodging.
;   Only applies while i-frames are active.

;   are active, as first person dodging is not animated.
;
	set LDQuest.DodgeFade to 2		;default 2 (first person)
;
; - Set whether to use the timed dodge feature. Dodging an
;   enemy Powerattack in melee range will briefly slow down time
;   and grant you a burst of speed.
;
;   Timed Dodges can only be triggered when rolling.
;
	set LDQuest.TimedDodge to 1	;default 1 (on)

;
;==========================================================================
;

	set LDQuest.BSFlatDamage to -10         ;(must be a negative value)
;
; - Level-based Backstab damage calculation is as follows:
;
;   (backstabdamage - attacker's level)
;
;   So if backstabdamage is set to -10, a level 1 character will
;   do 11 damage on a backstab, and a level 50 character will
;   do 60 damage.
; 
	set LDQuest.BackstabDamage to -10	;default -10

;
;   Also reduces enemy chasing potential. Conflicts with the attack
;   commitment option above so please do not enable both at the same time.

	set LDQuest.CrouchRegen to 0		;default 0 (off)
;
;==========================================================================
;
; 11. ENEMY AI/CREATURE AI
;
; - Set whether enemy AI should be enabled.
;   Enemies will be more aware of the player's actions during combat.
;
;   They will also gain the ability to Bash and dodge certain attacks.
;  
;   This feature requires Poise to be enabled, because otherwise
;   enemies might get stuck trying to break your Poise which would
;   cause them to keep throwing basic attacks non-stop.
;
;   Set to 0 to disable,
;   Set to 1 to always enable,
;   Set to 2 to only enable in interiors,
;   Set to 3 to disable on lower level enemies,

;
	set LDQuest.EnemyAI to 1		;default 1
;
; - Enemies are allowed to bash the player out of powerattacks/blocks

;
	set LDQuest.AIDodgeType to 1	;default 1
;
; - Set whether to enable the enemy AI Chase fix.
;   This will greatly reduce the chances of enemy vanilla chase behavior.
;   (the one where they constantly swing their weapons while chasing)
;
;   Enemies will either run or walk towards you without swinging their
;   weapons instead.
;
;   Kicks into effect every time you disengage from enemies.
;
;   Note: requires Enemy AI to be enabled so that enemies can react
;   in time and break out of their chase animation, if attacked.
;
;   Set to 0 to disable
;   Set to 1 to either walk or run
;   Set to 2 for a small chance to also keep vanilla behavior
;
	set LDQuest.AIChaseFix to 2		;default 2
;
; - Set whether basic Creature AI should be enabled.
;
;   A simplified version of the mod's NPC AI, this speeds up
;   combat timers for Creatures so they can chain multiple
;   attacks together.
;
;   It also adds the anti-attack spam behavior from the mod's
;   NPC AI to creatures with weapons and shields, along with
;   a couple of other condition-based behaviors.
;
;   Set to only affect stronger creatures by default.
;
;   Set to 0 to disable,
;   Set to 1 to enable for all creatures,
;   Set to 2 to only enable in interiors,
;   Set to 3 to disable on lower level creatures,
;   Set to 4 to disable on lower level creatures + only enable in interiors
;
	set LDQuest.CreatureAI to 3		;default 3
;
; - Whether to enable chase idles for creatures. Forces creatures
;   to get in range before being allowed to attack, which improves
;   behavior of creatures like Clannfears, Wolves, and Goblins,
;   who constantly spam jumping powerattacks otherwise.
;
;   Set to 0 to disable,
;   Set to 1 to enable on creatures that jump around a lot,
;   Set to 2 to enable for all creatures
;
;   Can cause unintended behavior with spellcaster creatures if
;   set to 2, since they'll have to be in range to cast spells.
;
	set LDQuest.CreatureAIChaseFix to 1	;default 1
;
; - Enemy AI/Creature AI scripts will only activate on enemies
;   if your FPS is above a certain number.
;
;   This is to keep it from further affecting performance
;   if your framerate is already unstable.
;
;   Set to a very low value to always have Enemy AI enabled.
;
	set LDQuest.AIMaxFPS to 41		;default 41 (above 40 FPS)
;
; - Enemy AI/Creature AI runs on a timer by default. This causes them
;   to switch combat styles or perform special moves at certain intervals.
;
;   Faster timers mean more responsive enemies at the cost of performance,
;   though near instant timers should still be fine with vanilla
;   spawn rates. 
;
;   I recommend leaving it on 'normal' otherwise, if using
;   OOO or similar mods.
;
;   Set to 0 for near instant timers,
;   Set to 1 for fast timers,
;   Set to 2 for normal timers,
;   Set to 3 for slow timers
;
	set LDQuest.AITimer to 2		;default 2 (normal)
;
; - Whether enemies should have their Fatigue reset to their maximum value once
;   they engage in combat with the player. 
;
;  The game doesn't seem to do this for subsequent enemies of the same 
;  type, which might cause certain enemies to run out of Fatigue quickly.
;
;   Having this option enabled should fix the above issue.
;
	set LDQuest.AIMaxFatigue to 1		;default 1 (on)
;
;==========================================================================
;
; 12. BASHING
;
; - Set whether to enable Bashing. Bashing deals 1 Poise damage
;   and will interrupt and stagger Powerattacking/Blocking enemies.
;
;   Bashing has a 1.5 second cooldown. 
;
;   Note: This feature uses the same quest as the Dodge feature,
;   and will most likely not function if Dodge is disabled.
;
;   This is done for performance reasons.
;
	set LDQuest.UseBash to 1		;default 1 (on)
;
; - Set the amount of stamina Bashing should cost.
;
;   Set to 0 to make Bashing cost no stamina,

;   Set to 3 for 5% of max Fatigue
;
	set LDQuest.BashCost to 3		;default 3 (5%)

;
; - Set whether succesfully staggering an enemy by Bashing should
;   immediately cancel the Bash animation. May look weird!
;
	set LDQuest.BashCancel to 0		;default 0 (off)
;
; - Set whether to also enable Bashing by pressing Attack while Blocking.
;
;   Note: Bashing will be disabled for a short time after succesfully Parrying an enemy
;   if this option is enabled, to prevent a control conflict that could otherwise occur.
;
;   It will also be disabled for a short while after being hit while blocking to allow
;   Guard Counters, which use the same combination of keys.
;
	set LDQuest.SkyrimBash to 1		;default 0 (off)
;
; - Whether a sound effect should play if a bash is attempted while it's on cooldown
;   or otherwise unavailable.
;
;   Set to 0 to disable (no sound or message),
;   Set to 1 to play a sound effect,
;   Set to 2 to display a message,
;   Set to 3 for both of the previous options
;
	set LDQuest.BashMessage to 1	;default 1 (sound effect)
;
; - Set the amount of player Strength attribute required for Bashing. (1-99)
;
	set LDQuest.BashReq to 1		;default 1 (always enabled)
;
;==========================================================================
;
; 13. LOCK-ON
;
; - This feature will let you lock-on to actors near the center
;   of the screen.
;
;   Note: Circling around your opponents too much/too fast may cause
;   the engine to get confused and can cause a glitch that leaves
;   you with a blank compass. Your attacks also won't hit anything.
;
;   If this happens, just slightly move your mouse up and down.
;
	set LDQuest.UseLockOn to 1		;default 1 (on)
;
; - Set the types of target that can be locked onto.

;
; 14. COMBAT RATING

;   combat performance depending on a variety of (MCA-related)
;   actions such as succesful powerattacks, timed dodges,
;   parries, succesful bashes, attack chains, and more.
;   
;   Rating varies from rank D to rank S+. Anything lower will not

My 7 Days To Die Mods.

### Tweaks

- [No Grass](./dl/NoGrass.7z)
> Removes grass entirely from the game. Makes it harder to get plant fibres now, I recommend the Less Grass mod over this completely.
- [Less Grass](./dl/LessGrass.7z)
> Reduces the amount of grass spawned.
- [Static XP](./dl/StaticXP.7z)
> Makes XP level up point static.

My Fallout 4 mods. 

[Biblioklept Gameplay Edits - Non-Tactical Reload Version](./dl/BibliokleptGameplayEdits.esp)

Small edits to Fallout 4 that remove some of my gripes from the game. These being: 
- No XP Bump (200 to level up always.)
- 42 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Points (Like the previous games.)
- Reworked weapon stats:
	- Assault Rifle 
		- Renamed Light Machine Gun
		- Rechambered in 5mm
		- Increased firerate by 20%
		- Increased default capacity to 50 rounds
		- Decreased damage by 5
		
		> These changes make the Assault Rifle more fitting of its model and (supposedly original) role of a machine gun.
		
	- Combat Rifle 
		- Rechambered in 5.56mm 
		- Increased damage by 2
		
		> My purpose for these changes is to replace the (now) Light Machine Gun's old role to replace it. This is now the assault rifle.
		
	- Handmade Rifle
		- Increased damage by 8
		
		> Made the rifle deal more damage to fit its larger calibre.
		
	- Laser Guns
		- Changed the Automatic and Sniper models to Long Barrel's model
		
		> I didn't like the other models for the Automatic and Sniper barrels.

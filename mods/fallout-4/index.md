My Fallout 4 mods. 

#### [Biblioklept Gameplay Edits](./dl/BibliokleptGameplayEdits.esp)
Small edits to Fallout 4 that remove some of my gripes from the game. These being:
- No XP Bump (200 to level up always.)
> Never liked games wasting my time, and after a couple playthoughs the grind you have to do gets old.  
Edits: iXPBumpBase in GameSettings

- 42 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Points (Like the previous games.)
> Might be a bit unbalanced, but it's here for the same reason as above.  
Edits: uSPECIALPoints in Game Settings

- Reworked weapon stats:
	- Assault Rifle 
		- Renamed Light Machine Gun
		- Rechambered in 5mm
		- Increased firerate by 20%
		- Increased default capacity to 50 rounds
		- Decreased damage by 5
		
		> These changes make the Assault Rifle more fitting of its model and (supposedly original) role of a machine gun.  
		Edits: AssaultRifle in Weapon
		
	- Combat Rifle 
		- Rechambered in 5.56mm 
		- Increased damage by 2
		
		> My purpose for these changes is to replace the (now) Light Machine Gun's old role to replace it. This is now the assault rifle.  
		Edits: CombatRifle in Weapon
		
	- Handmade Rifle
		- Increased damage by 8
		
		> Made the rifle deal more damage to fit its larger calibre.  
		Edits: DLC04_HandMadeGun in Weapon
		
	- Laser Guns
		- Changed the Automatic and Sniper models to Long Barrel's model
		
		> I didn't like the other models for the Automatic and Sniper barrels. They're as ugly as the assault rifle.

**If you don't like any of these edits, feel free to remove said edit in xEdit.**

I would recommend using [Leveled Item Fixes (LIF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63914) to integrate the handmade rifle and its ammo.

#### [Weightless Items INI](./dl/WeightlessItems.ini)
Removes weight only from alchemy, miscellaneous items (i.e. junk), ingredients, and books. Keeps the game relatively fair. [Required Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/73640).

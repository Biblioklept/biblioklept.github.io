<h1>!! WIP !!</h1>

<h1>prelude - reasoning</h1>
<p>my fear of death for a while lied in not being remembered, but no longer do i feel that way. over time my aspirations and fears simplified. that fear of not being remembered faded, and the fear of dying without the person that was meant for me replaced it. i found that person, and i lost them. i blame this on no one but myself, the guilt i've felt over the past couple of days has been immense, i've stopped eating, i drink whenever necessary, i can't sleep anymore, and i just lie on the floor without doing anything for hours at a time. the only thing keeping me company during this is the guilt i carry. everyone has their breaking point, i believe i've found mine. i don't deserve peace after what i've done, i just want this to be done and over with. please don't get this mixed up, i'm not killing myself over purely a girl, but rather the guilt i feel after essentially betraying someone i dearly loved, i don't think i could ever live with that. i honestly couldn't tell which punishment i deserved more, to die or to be tormented, but i feel this is a more permanent punishment, and as such, it's the one i'm going with. i can only hope marina can forgive me, and that's all i'd ever want.</p>

<h1>individual goodbyes</h1>
<p>Marina: i'm sorry, please forgive me. i love you. please don't carry the belief that this death is your fault, it was mine. you deserved better than me, and that'll come, just please keep doing what makes you comfortable with yourself, that's all i ask of you.</p>

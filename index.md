# Biblioklept's Site
A one stop shop for everything I've made.

- [Modlists](./modlists)
> Modlists I've made. The supported ones.
- [Mods](./mods)
> Mods I've made that don't really deserve their own nexus page. Here's my [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79495983) if you're interested.
- [Scripts](./scripts)
> Scripts I've made to ease up my modding, to be used with Windows.
- [IWADs](./iwads)
> I didn't make these, but this is my take on the repositories of IWAD files you can find everywhere on GitHub.

<p>- <a title="Call of The Old Zone" href="https://biblioklept.github.io/cotoz">Call of The Old Zone</a> - for <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of The Zone</em>.</p>
<p>vanilla+ call of the zone modlist, i don't play it anymore, but here it is.</p>
<p>- <a title="lowercase ttw" href="https://biblioklept.github.io/lowercasettw">lowercase ttw</a> - for <em>Tale of Two Wastelands</em>.</p>
<p>a lightweight modlist for tale of two wastelands that aims to use as minimal esp files as possible, i think i did an ok job.</p>
<p>- <a title="JOURNEY" href="https://biblioklept.github.io/JOURNEY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JOURNEY</a> - for <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Anomaly</em>.</p>
<p>my latest modlist. a vanilla+ stalker anomaly modlist, meant to be as a base for your own modlists, however it's good fun on its own and it's how i prefer my game to be.</p>

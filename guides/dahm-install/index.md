Modding PDTH with DAHM/DorHUD

### Installing DAHM Itself
1. Download either the "full version" (**all submods**) or the "essential version" (**essential mods only**) - [Download here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/dahm4pd/discussions/3/3810655600549061009/#:~:text=redist.x86.exe-,latest%20version,-Download%201.16).
2. Install it into your root PDTH folder.

### Editing Corpse Despawn
This is a dirty edit of an already existing file in the full version of DAHM's files. Backup your mod and heed notice.
1. Go to the mod `corpse_despawn`.
2. Edit `enemymanager.lua`.
3. Go to lines 14 - 19 and change any of the values post-equals symbol (I personally do not edit the intervals.).

### Borderless Window Plugin
Allows your game to run in borderless windowed mode.

- [Borderless Window Plugin for DorHUD](https://steamcommunity.com/app/24240/discussions/0/3765606580163061345/#c3765607014586473776)
> Install this into your `plugins` folder in your PDTH folder. If you don't have one, make one.
- [Borderless Window Plugin for DorHUD - INI](./dl/pdthhook.ini)
> Install this into your root PDTH folder.

### A Couple Other Neat Mods I Personally Use
Install these mods into your `mods` folder in your PDTH folder. If you don't have one, make one.

> Removes the camera breathing effect, the melee camera shake and the camera shake effect when getting shot at.
- [No Post Processing But With Outlines](https://modworkshop.net/mod/46356)

- [Diamond Heist Detection Meter](https://modworkshop.net/mod/34123)

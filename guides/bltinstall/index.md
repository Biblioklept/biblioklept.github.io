Modding PD2 with SuperBLT

### Installing SuperBLT Itself
1. Download the latest release of [SuperBLT](https://superblt.znix.xyz/#:~:text=wsock32%3Dn%2Cb%22%20%25command%25-,download%20the%20latest%20release%20dll,-%2C%0Aand%20place%20it).
2. Install it into your root PD2 folder.
3. Create a `mods` folder in your root PD2 folder.
4. Create a `mod_overrides` folder in your assets folder.

### Installing BeardLib
1. Download the latest release of [BeardLib](https://modworkshop.net/mod/14924).
2. Extract the BeardLib folder into your `mods` folder.

### Moving Forward
- You are free to pick and choose whichever mods you wish to install. 
- If you want a recommendation for the pure essentials, the T-PACK b-raw mod.txt install and the Bug Fixes section are all you need to run the game well. The rest of these mods are optimizations for lower end computers and small files to aid you in gameplay.
- HUD mods are everywhere, and there's quite a few that don't work right. Please make sure if you use a hud mod to check if it's still updated.

### T-PACK
T-PACK does a lot of things by itself, however, I've made my own mod.txt file to replace the one in the regular T-PACK to remove all the silly and gameplay altering mods. Here's how you install my modified T-PACK.
1. Download and install [T-PACK](https://pd2mods.z77.fr/t-pack.html).
2. Go to [my modified T-PACK mod.txt files](https://gist.github.com/Biblioklept/4db89e8ef03738c99b9c73bb64fa89fa) (choose whichever by description sounds more your style.) and click on **Raw**.
3. Press **CTRL + S**
4. Move the mod.txt file to your T-PACK mod folder and overwrite.
5. Now launch your game and download all updates.

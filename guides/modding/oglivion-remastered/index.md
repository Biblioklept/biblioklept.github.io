Oblivion Remastered for Original Oblivion

### Purpose

With the Oblivion "Remaster" (more of a remake with all the unfaithful changes), there's a bunch of features and changes that I find welcoming for revisiting and new players alike. However, the Oblivion remaster is on Unreal Engine 5, an engine notorious for poor performance with cranked to the max graphics. If you're too poor or simply not interested in buying it, the major changes I've noted through my 2 hours of playing through it are going to be listed here as mods you can use for your original Oblivion playthough, with some extra things that the remake completely forgot to address.

### Base

I would recommend using the [Oblivion For Modern PCs in 2025](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/54158) guide to get a good baseline setup for Oblivion. This will provide all bug and stability fixes required to get the game running.

### User Interface

- [Link Plus Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/53352)
> MCM-like menu for mods that support it.
- [NorthernUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/48577)
> This is pretty much what they did for the HUD in the remake. Slight differences here and there but this is also likely more usable than the one in the remake (way less tabs.)
- [Imperial Theme for NorthernUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/49848)
> Makes NothernUI fit more into Oblivion.
- [Loot Menu - NorthernUI Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/50114)
> A feature wholly missing from the Oblivion remake, adds a loot menu.

### Content

The Oblivion remake doesn't add much new content besides new voices for races and the Deluxe Edition DLC. [Weapon Expansion Pack for Oblivion Nthusiasts](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/35560) would be a great stand-in for those. It makes the Oblivion arsenal more complete and also fixes weapons.

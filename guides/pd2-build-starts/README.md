PAYDAY 2 Build Starts (per Perk Deck (for Vanilla))

### [Baseline](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-4100081100010-51010-4100)

This is the baseline for the rest of the builds going forward. There are some skills you can remove that won't be too detrimental for extra points. Those being:

- Hardware Expert
- Nine Lives

This will give you 5 points in total.

### [Crew Chief](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1Q3I1000sz1000120-41010-4100&p=0&a=6&d=5)

Many think this deck is weak, but it is actually a great support deck and benefits from support skills. Play the deck as a support role. Additionally, remove and change the skills to fit how you want to support your team, this setup just has all of them applied. If you need some guidelines on how to remove certain parts:

- Revert Improved Combined Tactical Vest - Remove all skills in Tank tree except for: Resilience (Aced + Basic) and Bullseye (Basic). Equip Heavy Ballistic Vest.
- Revert Drill Skills - Remove Drill Sawgent (Aced + Basic)
- Change Deployable to Doctor Bag - Change Quick Fixed (Aced + Basic) and Uppers (Aced + Basic) to Painkillers (Aced + Basic) and Combat Doctor (Aced + Basic). Equip Doctor Bag.
- Change Deployable to Ammo Bag (Primary) + Doctor Bag (Secondary) - Remove all skills in Medic tree except for: Combat Medic (Basic). Add Bulletstorm (Aced + Basic), Extra Lead (Aced + Basic) and Fully Loaded (Basic) skills in Ammo Specialist tree. Optionally, add Portable Saw (Aced + Basic) and equip OVE9000 Portable Saw in secondary.

### [Muscle](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-51010-4100&p=1&a=3)

### [Armorer](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-410008N100010-51010-4100&p=2&a=6)

### [Rogue](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-6110-4100&p=3&a=0)

- [More Dodge - V1 Setup](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-5w710-4100&p=3&a=0)

Allows for more concealment on weapons, movement speed, and reloading while sprinting (both good and bad).

- [More Dodge - V2 Setup](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-5Eh10-4100&p=3&a=0)

Gives chance to backfire tasers and gives staggers who shoot you initially (and for 6 seconds post-armor recovery).

### [Hitman]()

### [Crook]()

### [Burglar]()

### [Infiltrator]()

### [Sociopath]()

### [Gambler]()

### [Grinder]()

### [Yakuza](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-4100081100010-55g01000158&p=b&a=0&t=6)

Yakuza's a weird deck, and I ended up deciding to prioritize speed, second chances after your armor breaks, and berzerker (as you'll be doing that anyways). Definitely a difficult perk deck to play but that's a part of the charm of the deck. 

### [Ex-President]()

### [Maniac]()

PAYDAY 2 Build Starts (per Perk Deck (for Vanilla))

### [Baseline](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-4100081100010-51010-4100)

This is the baseline for the rest of the builds going forward. There are some skills you can remove that won't be too detrimental for extra points. Those being:

- Hardware Expert
- Nine Lives

This will give you 5 points in total.

### [Crew Chief](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1Q3I1000sz1000120-41010-4100&p=0&a=6&d=5)

Many think this deck is weak, but it is actually a great support deck and benefits from support skills. Play the deck as a support role. Additionally, remove and change the skills to fit how you want to support your team, this setup just has all of them applied. If you need some guidelines on how to remove certain parts:

- Revert Improved Combined Tactical Vest - Remove all skills in Tank tree except for: Resilience (Aced + Basic) and Bullseye (Basic). Equip Heavy Ballistic Vest.
- Revert Drill Skills - Remove Drill Sawgent (Aced + Basic)
- Change Deployable to Doctor Bag - Change Quick Fixed (Aced + Basic) and Uppers (Aced + Basic) to Painkillers (Aced + Basic) and Combat Doctor (Aced + Basic). Equip Doctor Bag.
- Change Deployable to Ammo Bag (Primary) + (optionally) Doctor Bag (Secondary) - Remove all skills in Medic tree except for: Combat Medic (Basic). Add Bulletstorm (Aced + Basic), Extra Lead (Aced + Basic) and Fully Loaded (Basic) skills in Ammo Specialist tree. Optionally, add Portable Saw (Aced + Basic) and equip OVE9000 Portable Saw in secondary. Lastly, add Third Law (Basic), Eco Sentry (Basic) and Jack of All Trades (Aced + Basic). Equip Ammo Bag primary and Doctor Bag secondary.

### [Muscle](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-51010-4100&p=1&a=3)

Muscle fills Stoic's role of tank with passive health regen instead of an active item and more health. This health regeneration is increased by Hostage Taker (Aced + Basic) increasing the regen to 9.5% of your total health every 5 seconds.

### [Armorer](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-410008N100010-51010-4100&p=2&a=6)

Armorer is the definition of tank. Incredible armor values with Improved Combined Tactical Vest, with 2 second god mode when it breaks. Definitely a more passive tank but still incredibly effective.

### [Rogue](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-6110-4100&p=3&a=0)

Rogue is the passive dodge deck, providing more dodge at a relatively static value. While it's not the most dodge, it's incredibly easy to get into and its chance to pierce armor makes it still pretty useful
for point economy. Without any extra flat dodge increases, the dodge of this build goes to 50.

- [More Dodge - V1 Setup](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-5w710-4100&p=3&a=0)

Allows for more concealment on weapons, movement speed, and reloading while sprinting (both good and bad, as while you can maintain pressure and speed, it's much more slow to reload cancel).

- [More Dodge - V2 Setup](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I100081100010-5Eh10-4100&p=3&a=0)

Gives chance to backfire tasers and gives staggers who shoot you initially (and for 6 seconds post-armor recovery), generally better than V1 unless you need the concealment.

### [Hitman]()

### [Crook](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-41000U5100010-6110-4100&p=5&a=3)

Crook is a mix of armor and dodge. Good for if you can't decide which playstyle to dedicate yourself to, however it might take some getting used to.

### [Burglar]()

### [Infiltrator]()

### [Sociopath]()

### [Gambler]()

### [Grinder](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-4100081100010-51010-4100&p=a&a=0)

Grinder is one of the most friendly decks to play if you're new to the game and don't really know where to start. Use gas grenades on grenade launchers and shoot spawn points and you should be good, just don't over extend.

### [Yakuza](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-4100081100010-55g01000158&p=b&a=0&t=6)

Yakuza's a weird deck, as such I ended up deciding to prioritize speed, second chances after your armor breaks, and berzerker (as you'll be doing that anyways). Definitely a difficult perk deck to play but that's a part of the charm of the deck. 

### [Ex-President]()

### [Maniac]()

### [Anarchist](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0038100081100010-51010-4100&p=e&a=0)

### [Biker]()

### [Kingpin]()

### [Sicario]()

### [Stoic](https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=003I10-41100010-51010-4100&p=i&a=3&t=c)

Stoic is the more aggressive and generally better Muscle. The same idea follows, however you don't use bulleye (as you have no armor to regenerate).

### PythonSDK
- [PythonSDK](https://github.com/Ry0511/willow1-mod-manager/releases/latest)
    - [Install Tutorial](https://github.com/Ry0511/willow1-mod-manager/blob/master/README.md#installation)
- [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/latest)

### Libraries
- [Custom UI SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/mods/customuisdk/)

### Fixes
- [Bloodwing Return Fix](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/mods/bloodwingreturnfix/)
> Currently only fixes the manual return.
- [Permanent FOV and Sprint Rotation Fix](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/mods/fovandsprintrotationfix/)
> Fixes diagonal sprint, Mordecai and Lilith melee zoom, FOV resetting, and the use key also being a reload key. Also lowers how much FOV increases when you sprint so that high FOVs still look good and FOV stays increased when you jump like in the rest of the series.
- [Scroll Wheel Fix](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/mods/scrollwheelfix/)
> Fixes weapons being out of order when switching with the scroll wheel.
- [Unofficial Patch SDK](https://bl-sdk.github.io/willow1-mod-db/mods/unofficialpatchsdk/)
> The SDK version has some more fixes (see the changes after 1.0.0) and has better compatibility with other mods, but it currently lacks the animation fixes that the UPK version has.

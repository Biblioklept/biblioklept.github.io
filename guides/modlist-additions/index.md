My Personal Modlist Additions

### Fallout 4

#### The Baseline

For this guide there will be a baseline install of ModdingLinked's modlists, which you can find [here](https://moddinglinked.com/)

#### Gameplay
- [Biblioklept Gameplay Edits](https://biblioklept.github.io/mods/fallout-4#biblioklept-gameplay-additions
- [Leveled Item Fixes (LIF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63914)
- [Weightless Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/73640)
> [Weightless Items INI](https://biblioklept.github.io/mods/fallout-4/#weightless-items-ini)

These are the mods I would recommend if you want to still keep the game relatively vanilla. The next couple of mods will delevel the world, and that's not for everyone, as it makes the inital game almost unfair.

- [Unleveled World - F4SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/72784)
- [SCOURGE - Unleveled and Standardised NPC Stats](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/60917)

#### Weapons
This section is to fill out more of the list and fill in the weapon roster a little bit more. T6M's mods are great for this as they're nif-bashed, same with the Unique Weapons Concept by the CSEP team. Here's the ones I personally use, along with some additions.

- [T6M's Standalone Handmade Shotgun](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/75813)
- [T6M's Pump-Action Shotgun](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57245)
- [The Heavy Weapons Pack - A Unique Weapon Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/59582)
- [Heavy Energy Weapon Combo Deal](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/63513)
- [Thompson SMG Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42225)
- [M1911 - WARS Standalone Weapon](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/49038)

> Note: Keep an eye on [Weapons Overhaul Systems](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/71653). Mod looks super interesting and might fit what I would've wanted out of WARS. It also seems to stick to a more nif-bashed and vanilla-esque asthetic.

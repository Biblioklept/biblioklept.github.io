- [G.A.M.M.A. Tedium Removal](./gammatediumremoval)
> A simple "enable this, disable this" guide to remove G.A.M.M.A.'s tedium. Feels good to have fun again.
- [G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS For Escape From Pripyat](./gammabhsforefp)
> Adds G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS into Escape From Pripyat, I liked it more.
- [Viva New Wastelands](./vnv-to-ttw)
> A guide to convert [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) to Tale of Two Wastelands
- [HSJ Lists](./hsj)
> Small lists of mods that require another modlist (your own or someone else's) to setup. I usually use these with vanilla+ modlists because there's some part of the game I still dislike. *Highly subjective, modular, and lightweight.*

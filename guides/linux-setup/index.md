Quick Linux Setup

### Choosing your distribution
- Arch vs Fedora vs Debian
	- Arch is for people who want the latest and widest amount of packages, even if bugs are to be encountered.
	- Fedora is for people who want the same as above, with less bugs, comes with less packages by default though.
	- Debian has the fewest amount of packages and has alternative methods for installing packages not included in Debian's package list.
- Noob-friendly-ness
	- The two distributions that are Windows-like on this list use Debian-based Ubuntu. However, they include their own package lists and may be better for those who are completely clueless without graphical user interfaces for everything.
- Important info for gamers
	- Check if your main games are supported:
		- [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) includes information to see if your game can even run on Linux period using the frontend of Proton.
		- [Are We Anti-Cheat Yet?](https://areweanticheatyet.com/) includes information to see if an online game with anti-cheat has Linux support.
			- Popular games that aren't supported include: Rust, Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite, Valorant, Apex Legends, Battlefield, etc.
	- Modding isn't the greatest on Linux.
		- Tools such as Vortex and Mod Organizer 2 have third-party installers, but can be tricky to setup/use for new people.
		- [Jackify](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Jackify?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start) is a great tool for people wanting to install Wabbajack modlists.

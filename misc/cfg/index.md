Configuration Files

- [OpenMW Config](./dl/configs/openmw/settings.cfg)
> Sets: textures to be chunky, FOV to 90, distant land to max, screenshot format to png.  
Disables: Water shaders, shadows, and anisotropy.  
Adds: Animation support (with additional anims), QoL settings.  
Move to `My Games/OpenMW`.

> Place in `User/Saved Games`.

> Move to Unturned installation folder.
- [Call of Duty Configs](./cod-cfg/)
- [Team Fortress 2 MasterComfig Files](./dl/configs/teamfortress2)
> My personalized MasterComfig files. **You need to install at least the NONE preset on [MasterComfig's site](https://comfig.app)**  
For my others settings, I recommend getting [technohud](https://github.com/tekunotri/technohud/releases/latest) and my [Quake 3 hit and kill sounds](https://biblioklept.github.io/mods/team-fortress-2/#quake-3-hit--kill-sounds).

> Move to `Users/User/Zomboid`.
- [GZDoom Vanilla Config](./dl/configs/gzdoom/vanilla.cfg)
> Move to GZDoom installation folder. Open the console and enter `exec vanilla.cfg`.
- [OpenShell Menu Settings](./dl/configs/openshell/Menu Settings.xml)
> Improves the Start Menu functionality to my liking (made to be used with Windows 10, Dark Mode). Internet searching is disabled and the search is reduced down to "apps" and programs. Rule of thumb: bloat is removed from the UX.
- [OpenShell Explorer Settings](./dl/configs/openshell/Explorer Settings.xml)
> Removes the status bar at the bottom.  
Install via `Backup > Load from XML file...`
- [Nilesoft Shell](./dl/configs/nilesoftshell/shell.nss)

Move to Nilesoft Shell installation folder.

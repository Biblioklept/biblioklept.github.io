### Tinsel Town Rebellion (Have I Offended Someone?)
```
From Madam Wong's to Starwood
To the Whiskey on the Strip
You can hear the crashing, blasting strum
Of bands that come to be real hip
And get a record contract
From a talent scout some day
They'll sell their ass, their cocks and balls
They'll take the check 'n walk away
If they're lucky they'll get famous
For a week or two perhaps
They'll buy some ugly clothes to wear
And hope the business don't collapse
Before some stupid magazine
Decides they're really good
They're a Tinsel Town Rebellion Band
From downtown Hollywood

Tinsel Town Rebellion,
Tinsel Town Rebellion Band
It's a little bitty Tinsel Town Rebellion
A Tinsel Town Rebellion Band

They used to play all kinds of stuff
And some of it was nice
Some of it was musical
But then they took some guy's advice
To get a record deal, he said,
They would have to be more punk
Forget their chops and play real dumb
Or else they would be sunk
So off they go to S.I.R. to learn some stupid riffs
(Oh no!)
No!
(No no no no no no)
No!
(It's the 80's again!)

And when they think they've got it
They launch a new career
Who gives a fuck if what they play
Is somewhat insincere
(Let's dance the blues again, get down
Dance the blues again, everybody
Dance the blues again, hey...
I write the songs that make the young girls cry!)

Did you know that in Tinsel Town the people down there
Think that substance is a bore
And if your New Wave group looks good
They'll hurry on back for more
Of leather groups
(Eye to eye
Rock you like a nincompoop!)
And plastic groups
(Whip it good!)
And groups that look real queer
(I'll tumble 4 ya!
I'll tumble 4 ya!
I'll tumble 4... )
(Moo moo moo moo moo
Moo moo moo moo moo
Moo moo moo moo moo
Moo moo moo MOO-AHHH!)
The Tinsel Town aficionados
Come to see and not to hear
But then again this system works
As perfect as a dream
It works for all of those record company pricks
Who come to skim the cream
From the cesspools of excitement
Where Jim Morrison once stood
It's the Tinsel Town Rebellion
From down down down
(Down down down)
Town town town
(Town town town)
Holl loll loll
(Holl loll loll)
Lly lly lly lly
Woo-oo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ood

Downtown Hollywood!
An incredible ugly little town!
It's really boring!

I'm all alone

Thinking about you

And the love we once knew
[G]             [Em]
And each time I do

I would know where to find you
[C]            [D]
And all my old friends
[G]                       [Em]
Because The Shields would sing...

"You're a thousand miles away..."
[G]                                 [Em]

"Heaven and Paradise

Walking through the front door

But I told you, baby
(Oh, Night owl)
[Am]    [D]         [G]  [Em]
I don't love you no more"

[D]
The Jaguars...

[G]   [Em] [C]              [D]
"Some day, when I'm awfully low
[G]     [Em]
And the world is cold
[C]            [D]           [G]     [Em]
I would feel a glow just thinking of you
[C]              [D]    [G]
Just the way you feel tonight"

[Em]
And The Jacks...

[G]            [Em]
"Why don't you write me, darling
[C]       [D]
Send me a letter
[G]         [Em]
Tell me you love me, dear
[C]          [D]
Make me feel better
[G] [Em]
I love you
[C]       [D]   [G]  [Em]

Valarie, you pig
Let your mind drift back to that night of the prom
And there I was kneeling by your side with my hand reaching up in a gesture of supplication for the red rickrack around the bottom of your white party dress
Valarie, you and I had just finished drinking a pint and a half of Romilar and we were really ripped
Oh, Valarie, you and me, baby, tore to the core
You was my teen-age queen
And the idol of my dreams
And...
And everything
And I wanted to make it with you
And I made it with you
And you gave me the clap

### Find Her Finer [+2] (The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life)
```
Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her

If you should see a girl on the street
Now maybe you might think she is sweet
But if you wanna tickle her treat
Now really, what should you do?
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)

Don't never let her know you are smart
The universe is no place to start
You gotta play it straight from the heart
She gwine renunciate you
(That's why you gotta...)

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her

Now maybe you might think this is crude
And maybe you might think I am rude
And maybe this approach I have spewed
Is not the one for you
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)

But believe me later on you'll find
As you impress her with your mind
That you would just be left behind
For a wiser fool
(So you might as well)

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her
[Continue for as long as necessary]

### Magdalena (Carnegie Hall)
```
There was a man
A little old man
Who lived in Montreal
With a wife and a kid
And a car and a house
And a teen-age daughter
With a see-thru blouse
Who loved to grunt and ball
And her name was Magdalena

Magdalena

The little old man
Came home one night
To his house in Montreal
He caught his daughter
In a blouse by the light
And he said to himself
"She looks all right!"
He reached for a tit
And grabbed it tight
And threw her up against the wall
(Blue Cross!)
Magdalena

Group:

My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
I work so hard, don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land

Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?

Howard:

Magdalena

The little old man
With the grubby little hand
Who lived in Montreal
Was drooling a bit
As he reached for a tit
And he said to himself
"This is gonna be it!"
But the girl turned around
And said, "Go eat shit!"
And ran on down the hall
Oh, right on, Magdalena!

Group:

My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near
I work so hard, don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land

Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?

Howard:

Magdalena, don't you tease me like this
In the hallway with your blouse and your tits
Wow if your mommy ever finds us like this
She'll call a lawyer, oh how mom will be pissed

Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena,
Daughter of the New York City slums,
I'd like to take you down with me, babe,
To the corner, honey,
And get a Sabrett hot dog,
And take it on home,
Perform lewd acts,
And eat it while it's warm.
And, Magdalena, can you see us walking down to Village Oldies together, baby,
And searching for that Penguins record that always gave you an orgasm in the eighth grade, you know what I mean, honey?
I remember well,
Honey, we can go through Central Park together,
And we can watch the sun come up over the bunny things where you get your picture taken and put on a pin at the children's zoo,
And then, after that, after that we can have a rancid sausage sandwich on Bleecker St.,
Yes,
And you get that drizzly shits and fart all the way home,
Oh, can't you see it now, honey,
New York has so much to offer. Why it's a fucking summer festival,
Fun city,
And it's yours, baby

Group:
Walk, walk, walk, walk on back... etc.

Howard:
It's for you and me,
It's our oyster,
Now believe me, Magdalena, when I saw you yesterday in the hallway,
I didn't mean to grab your little tittie there,
I said, "My God, my own daughter, my flesh and blood,
I gave my sperm to this kid and now all of a sudden I'm hard as a rock,"
You know what I mean?
I reached out
And I pulled your little nipple closer to me, darling,
And your mommy walked in and said,
"Harry... "

Group:
Your mom will never know, your mom will never know... etc.

Howard:
"Harry, what are you doing with Magdalena's nipple?"
There was nothing I could say, Magdalena,
But if you just walk back to me, honey,
We don't need her,
We don't need Ian, we don't need George, we don't need anybody,
Magdalena, turn around under that DayGlo picture of Jesus we bought at the, at the, at the Night Owl, baby,
Come on, turn around, come back to me,
Your mom'll never know,
Your mom'll never know,
Your mom'll never know,
Your mom'll never know,
You gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Come back to your daddy,
Please, Magdalena, I need you so,
Why, it'll just be you and me, honey,
We could take the Staten Island ferry together,
We can go see No, No, Nanette and Promises, Promises,
We can go to Shirley Bassey at the Waldorf-Astoria,
Why, there's nothing we can't do together, my darling,
Come back to your daddy,
It's you and me, Magdalena, for the rest of our lives...

### Jesus Thinks You're A Jerk [Cutdown Trump Version] (Broadway The Hard Way)
```
There's an ugly wasel 'bout six-foot two
Face puffed up from cryin' 'n lyin'
And he's a little busy
Suckin' prong part time
In the name of The Lord

Get a clue, ya' fuckin shrew
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Jesus thinks you're a jerk

Did he really choose Donny to do His Work?
(Nuh uh!)

Elon says that he's The One
Oh sure he is,
if Armageddon
Is your idea of family fun,
An' he's got some planned for you!
Now, tell me that ain't true

Now, what if Jimbo's slightly gay,
Will Trump let Jimbo get away?
Everything we've heard him say
Indicated that Jim must pay,
(And it just might hurt a bit)
Just a bit!
But keep that money rollin' in,
'Cause crooked filthy Trump
Can't get enough of it

Perhaps it's their idea
Of an Affirmative Action Plan
To give White Trash a 'special break';
Well, they took those Jeezo-bucks and ran
To the bank! To the bank! To the bank! To the bank!
And every night we can hear them thank
Their Buddy, up above
For sending down his love
While you all smell the glue

Trump and Musk should take a pole
Right up each used up glory-hole,
With tar and feathers too --
Just like they'd love to do to you

('Cause they think you are bad --)
YES THEY DO!
(And they are very mad)

'Cause some folks don't want prayer in school!
We'd need an ark to survive the drool
Of Micro-publicans, raised on hate,
And 'Jimbo-Jimbo' when they graduate

Conviced they are 'The Chosen Ones'
And all their parents carry guns,
And hold them cards in the N.R.A.
With their fingers on the triggers
When they kneel and pray

With a Ku-Klux muu-muu
In the back of the truck,
If you ain't Born Again,
They wanna mess you up, screamin':
"No abortion, no-siree!"
"Life's too precious, can't you see!"
What's that hangin' from the neighbor's tree?
Why, it looks like 'colored folks' to me --
(Would THEY do THAT...)
They've been doing it for years!
(Seriously?)

When Donny gets in the White House,
And suddenly --
The rights of 'certain people' disappear
Mysteriously?

Now, wouldn't that sort of qualify
As an American Tragedy?
Especially if he covers it up, sayin'
"Jesus told it to me!"

I hope we never see that day,
In The Land of The Free --
Or someday will we?
Will we?

And if you don't know by now,
The truth of what I'm tellin' you,
Then, surely I have failed somehow
Then, surely I have failed somehow!

And Jesus will think I'm a jerk, just like you
If you let those plastic people
Make a monkey out of you!

I said:
"Jesus will think you're a jerk"
And it will be true!

Trump and Elon!
Oh, baby!
You gotta go!
You really got to go

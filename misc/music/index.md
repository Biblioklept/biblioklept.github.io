The Jaguars...

[G]   [Em] [C]              [D]
"Some day, when I'm awfully low
[G]     [Em]
And the world is cold
[C]            [D]           [G]     [Em]
I would feel a glow just thinking of you
[C]              [D]    [G]
Just the way you feel tonight"

[Em]
And The Jacks...

[G]            [Em]
"Why don't you write me, darling
[C]       [D]
Send me a letter

Oh, Valarie, you and me, baby, tore to the core
You was my teen-age queen
And the idol of my dreams
And...
And everything
And I wanted to make it with you
And I made it with you
And you gave me the clap

### Find Her Finer [+2] (The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life)
```
Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her

If you should see a girl on the street
Now maybe you might think she is sweet
But if you wanna tickle her treat
Now really, what should you do?
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)

Don't never let her know you are smart
The universe is no place to start
You gotta play it straight from the heart
She gwine renunciate you
(That's why you gotta...)

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her

Now maybe you might think this is crude
And maybe you might think I am rude
And maybe this approach I have spewed
Is not the one for you
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)

But believe me later on you'll find
As you impress her with your mind
That you would just be left behind
For a wiser fool
(So you might as well)

Find her finer, sneak up behind her
Wrapped like a mummy till you finally unwind her
Find her blinder, see who designed her
Act like a dummy till you finally grind her
[Continue for as long as necessary]

Plastic people
You gotta go

Plastic people
You gotta go

A fine little girl
She waits for me
She's as plastic
As she can be
She paints her face
With plastic goo
And wrecks her hair
With some shampoo

Plastic people
You gotta go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Plastic people
You gotta go

Take a day
And walk around
Watch the nazis
Run your town
Then go home
And check yourself
You think we're singing
'Bout someone else
But you're

Plastic people
You gotta go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Plastic people
You gotta go

Bullshit.

Me see a neon
Moon above
I searched for years
And found no love
I'm sure that love
Will never be
A product of
Plasticity

Plastic people
You gotta go

Plastic people
You gotta go

You gotta go

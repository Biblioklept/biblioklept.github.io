My Miscellaneous Files

### Configuration Files
- [Cheat Fallout File](./dl/fallout/cheat)
> Sets all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats to 10 and also adds Scrapper perks if you're in Fallout 4 (vanilla IDs). Works with Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4.
- [OpenMW Settings Config File](./dl/openmw/settings.cfg)
> Sets: textures to be chunky, FOV to 90, distant land to max, screenshot format to png.  
Disables: Water shaders, shadows, and anisotropy.  
Adds: Animation support (with additional anims), QoL settings.  
There's more, but this is the major changes.
- [OpenShell Menu Settings](./dl/openshell/Menu Settings.xml)
> Improves the Start Menu functionality to my liking (made to be used with Windows 10, Dark Mode). Internet searching is disabled and the search is reduced down to "apps" and programs. Rule of thumb: bloat is removed from the UX.
- [OpenShell Explorer Settings](./dl/openshell/Explorer Settings.xml)
> Removes the status bar at the bottom.

### AHK Scripts
It's recommended that you use the [Ahk2Exe](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe/releases/latest) program to convert these to an executable script. The scripts are editable with a simple notepad program (Notepad++ recommended for Windows users).

- [Centre Window](./dl/ahk/centrewindow.ahk)
> Centres windows to be in the centre of your screen, pressing it again will swap it to a different monitor. **Default keybind is Alt + C.**
- [Spacebar Spam](./dl/ahk/spacebarspam.ahk)
> Spams spacebar. **Default keybind is F3.**

My Modlists

### Actively Worked On

- [HyperEssentials](https://github.com/Biblioklept/hyperessentials)
> An on-going project to provide a simple Wabbajack installation to get the game running with anything else you'd need to run mods (script extender mods for Bethesda games) and usually a quickstart if warrented.

### Infrequently Updated (LTS)

- [Dusty Sands](https://github.com/Biblioklept/dusty-sands)
> A modlist that attempts to recreate the Dust experience in the vanilla New Vegas gameworld, while expanding on what we were given with tweaks that improve New Vegas itself.
- [JOURNEY](./journey/)
> My attempt to do a rework of EXPEDITION, with a focus on being more vanilla+, modular, and slimming down the stuff I found unnecessary to the STALKER Anomaly experience.
- [COTOZ](./cotoz/)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.

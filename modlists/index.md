My Modlists

### Actively Worked On
- [Lethal Company Plus](./lethal-company-plus)
> A vanilla+ modpack for Lethal Company.
- [Old World Addon Plus](./old-world-addon-plus)
> A vanilla+ modlist for the Old World Addon mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly.
- [Dust and Death]
> A vanilla+ modlist for Fallout: New Vegas.

### Infrequently Updated (LTS)
- [Dusty Sands](https://github.com/Biblioklept/dusty-sands)
> A modlist that attempts to recreate the Dust experience in the vanilla New Vegas gameworld, while expanding on what we were given with tweaks that improve New Vegas itself.
- [JOURNEY](./journey/)
> My attempt to do a rework of EXPEDITION, with a focus on being more vanilla+, modular, and slimming down the stuff I found unnecessary to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly experience.
- [COTOZ](./cotoz/)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.

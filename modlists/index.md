My Modlists

### Actively worked on

- **NEW!** [Dusty Sands](https://github.com/Biblioklept/dusty-sands)
> A modlist that attempts to recreate the Dust experience in the vanilla New Vegas gameworld, while expanding on what we were given with tweaks that improve New Vegas itself.
- [HyperEssentials](https://github.com/Biblioklept/hyperessentials)
> An on-going project to provide a simple Wabbajack installation to get the game running with anything else you'd need to run mods (script extender mods for Bethesda games) and usually a quickstart if warrented.
- [JOURNEY](./journey/)
> My attempt to do a rework of EXPEDITION, with a focus on being more vanilla+, modular, and slimming down the stuff I found unnecessary to the STALKER Anomaly experience.
- [The Midnight Ride Extended](./tmr-extended)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride that aim to improve the user experience further with some more subjective mods. Essentially it removes my personal gripes from the game while adding minimal content.

### Still worked on, though not actively

- [COTOZ](./cotoz/)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.

### Work in progress

- [The Sink - New Vegas](https://github.com/Biblioklept/the-sink-nv)
> A kitchen sink modlist for New Vegas that doesn't try to make the game ridiculously difficult and while maintaining a nice balance.

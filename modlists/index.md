My Modlists

### Actively Worked On
- [Lethal Company Plus](./lethal-company-plus)
> A vanilla+ modpack for Lethal Company.
- [Dust and Death](./dust-and-death)
> A vanilla+ modlist for Fallout: New Vegas.

### Infrequently Updated (LTS)
- [COTOZ](./cotoz)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.
- [Super Simple S.T.A.L.K.E.R.](./super-simple-stalker)
> Quick and small sets of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. modlists. Irons some things out that are consistently in your face and some quality of life, tries to keep the mods sub-30 enabled. **These lists assume you know how to operate Mod Organizer 2.**
- [Borderlands Modlists](./borderlands-2-tps-modlist)
> Simple modlist to add a couple of quality of life fixes to BL2/TPS.

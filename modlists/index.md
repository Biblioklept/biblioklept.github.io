My Modlists

### Actively Worked On
- [Lethal Company Plus](./lethal-company-plus)
> A vanilla+ modpack for Lethal Company.
- [Dust and Death](./dust-and-death)
> A vanilla+ modlist for Fallout: New Vegas.

### Infrequently Updated (LTS)
- [COTOZ](./cotoz)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.
- [Super Simple Lists](./super-simple-lists)
> Quick and small sets of modlists. Polishes/reduces things out that are consistently in your face and adds some quality of life.

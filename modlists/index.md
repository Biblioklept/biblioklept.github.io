Modlists

### Actively worked on

- [HSJ Lists](./hsj)
> Modlists that require another modlist (your own or someone else's) to setup. I usually use these with vanilla+ modlists because there's some part of the game I still dislike. Highly subjective, modular, and lightweight.
- [HyperEssentials](./hyperessentials)
> An on-going project to provide a simple Wabbajack installation to get the game running with anything else you'd need to run mods (script extender mods for Bethesda games) and usually a quickstart if warrented. 

### Still worked on, though not actively

- [JOURNEY](./journey)
> My attempt to do a rework of EXPEDITION, with a focus on being more vanilla+, modular, and slimming down the stuff I found unnecessary to the STALKER Anomaly experience.
- [COTOZ](./cotoz)
> My vanilla+ modpack for Call of The Zone (RIP DR.X), with the only new content really being a reduction of the hud and animations. My preferred way to play the game.

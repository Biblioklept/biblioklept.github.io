## Changelog

### Update 1.0.3
- Save safe.
- Updated mods.
- Added DLC Hostility Fixes - ESPless by ObieDwyer.

Thank you to Fish in the Discord server for pointing it out to me in DMs. However please use the support channel for the modlist to report bugs.

### Update 1.0.2
- Save safe.
	- Important note: **Re-enable Vigor - Armor Integration if not on a new save**. While the Armor assets and items are built into Vigor base, it's best to be safe.
- Updated mods.
- Added ySI - Assorted Fixes by Stentorious.
- Added Pip-Boy Holo Panel ESPless by Wombat.
- Added AI Merge by carxt.
- Added Vigor - Expired and Homemade Stimpak Removal by Biblioklept.
- Added Sandy Dunes by AceeQ and Biggie404.
- Made Vigor - Armor Integration an optional file.
	- They weren't as close to the vision of the mod list. Qolore said it best:
		> Removed the "unique" armors added to vendors. The implementation and quality felt very underwhelming to me and I don't see them as something that would have ever been included in vanilla.

### Update 1.0.1
- Save safe.
- Updated mods.
- Removed ySI - Colorful Icons Fix by Stentorious.
- Added [NoDelete] tags to large installers.
- Made the 4GB required for the user to install on their own, as it could cause incompatibilities with the GOG and Epic Games version.
- Ultimate Edition ESM fixes are now included in the install.
- Vanilla UI Plus should now be prevented from being uninstallable.

Thank you to [TDarkShadow](https://github.com/TDarkShadow) for the information on the Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes, 4GB patch installation, and Vanilla UI Plus reuploads.

### Update 1.0.0
- Initial release

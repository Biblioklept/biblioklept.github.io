### Update 1.0.2
- Save safe.
	- Important note: **Re-enable Vigor - Armor Integration if not on a new save**. While the Armor assets and items are built into Vigor base, it's best to be safe.
- Updated mods.
- Added ySI - Assorted Fixes by Stentorious.
- Added Pip-Boy Holo Panel ESPless by Wombat.
- Added AI Merge by carxt.
- Added Vigor - Expired and Homemade Stimpak Removal by Biblioklept.
- Added Sandy Dunes by AceeQ and Biggie404.
- Made Vigor - Armor Integration an optional file.
	- They weren't as close to the vision of the mod list. Qolore said it best:
		> Removed the "unique" armors added to vendors. The implementation and quality felt very underwhelming to me and I don't see them as something that would have ever been included in vanilla.

### Update 1.0.1
- Save safe.
- Updated mods.
- Removed ySI - Colorful Icons Fix by Stentorious.
- Added [NoDelete] tags to large installers.
- Made the 4GB required for the user to install on their own, as it could cause incompatibilities with the GOG and Epic Games version.
- Ultimate Edition ESM fixes are now included in the install.
- Vanilla UI Plus should now be prevented from being uninstallable.

Thank you to [TDarkShadow](https://github.com/TDarkShadow) for the information on the Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes, 4GB patch installation, and Vanilla UI Plus reuploads.

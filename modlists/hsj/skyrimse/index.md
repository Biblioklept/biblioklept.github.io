HSJ - Skyrim SE

### Base

It's recommended to install a baseline modlist via Wabbajack, [Skyrim Modding Essentials](https://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/sme/) or [Animonculory Dev Tools - Next Generation](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/ADT)

This list will be built off the belief you're using one or the other.

### Animation

[Feral - Claw Unarmed Attacks for Beast Races](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34552)

Animation replacer for unarmed attacks of Khajiit, Argonians, Vampires and Werewolves.

[Comprehensive First Person Animation Overhaul - CFPAO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87169)

Adds thousands of first person animations that overwrite the janky and outdated vanilla ones. Includes unique animations depending on weapon type.

### Quick Start

[Optional Quick Start - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63953)

Adds an option to skip the introduction.

[Humble Beginnings - A Lightweight Class Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83910)

[Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888)

Completely overhauls the game. Read the mod page to learn more, you will need compatibility patches with content mods you install.

[True Unleveled Skyrim (LE and SE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18342)

Provides a simple, modular, compatible-with-everything solution for those who want to play in the unleveled world.

[True Equipment Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18157)

A good companion to the above mod and overhauls a lot and does more than just unleveling, to make it closer to the Requiem experience.

Changes the gamepad icons from xbox to Playstation for use with SkyUI.

HSJ - Fallout 4

### Base

It's recommended to install a baseline modlist, [Fallout 4 Modding Essentials](https://github.com/GozerBlackCat/FO4ME) (Wabbajack, fixes only with some tweaks) or [The Midnight Ride](https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com)

This list will be built off the belief you're using one or the other.

### Weapons

[Commonwealth Weapons Proliferation](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/62576)
> A level list replacer to replace all the guns in Fallout 4 with simply better overall weapons. **Check the requirements section to see what weapons you want to use/download.**

[Iron Sights Fixes for Modded Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68686)
> Fixes iron sights for modded weapons. **Download: Select Assault Rifle Iron sights fix; XR92 Zoom Fix and Sound Replacer (*if using above file*).**

### Quickstart (+ Additions)

[SKK Fast Start - New Game](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29227)
> The most quick and clean quick start currently available. Doesn't edit any other quests besides exiting the vault.

[SKK Fast Start - Location](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31198)
> Allows you to choose where you spawn, with gear, levels, quests, etc. Works in tandum with New Game.

[SKK Fast Start - Reunions](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30926)
> Go straight from Vault 111 to Fort Hagen to accelerate the main quest.

[SKK Fast Start - Minutemen](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/37740)
> Auto complete some of the initial Minutemen quests to unlock their support without the repetitive grind.

[SKK Fast Start - Institute](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38049)
> Relay direct to the Institute to accelerate the main quest with any faction, includes a soft kickout option if you don't want to shoot your way out.

### Crafting System Stuff

[LootMan](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42443)
> Provides the ability to automatically collect items into a dedicated inventory or link a dedicated inventory to a workshop.

**IT IS RECOMMENDED YOU TWEAK THIS TO NOT BE OVERPOWERED, AS THE DEFAULT SETTINGS WILL TRIVIALIZE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE GAME**

Alex's Fallout 4 Overhaul - Crafting Only
> My edit of Alex's Fallout 4 Overhaul to only have the crafting recipes from their mod.

> **Unreleased, Working On Permissions.**

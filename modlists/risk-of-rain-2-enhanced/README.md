### Description
Risk of Rain 2 Enhanced is a modpack that aims to add as little gameplay-affecting content as possible, small gameplay tweaks, and quality of life mods.

### Notes on Mods:
- InstancedLoot_continuation fixes the "loot hording friend(s)" issue but can break the balance of the game. I recommend removing/disabling this if your friends are actually willing to buy something and realize that the loot is better for you.
- InstantTeleporter will make the gameplay faster as when you defeat the boss the teleporter will instantly charge rather than making you wait.
- UnmoddedVersion is mandatory for this to work with vanilla clients.
- StutterStunterFork is not recommended to be used under 6-8gb of RAM, disable if this applies to you.

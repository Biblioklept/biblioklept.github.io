THESE ARE UNSUPPORTED.



### Archived Modlists
- [The Midnight Ride Extended](./tmr-extended)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride that aim to improve the user experience further with some more subjective mods. Essentially it removes my personal gripes from the game while adding minimal content.  
Archived 11/11/2023.  
Reason: I have severely reduced the amount of mods I use on top, as such, I have no desire to update this list.
- [The Midnight Ride WARS](./tmr-wars)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride to install the WARS mod (and some of its sub-mods) on top of it.  
Archived 11/11/2023.  
Reason: WARS is extremely finicky and deeply unsatisfying to play personally, weapons were neat though.
- [JOURNEY](./journey)
> My attempt to do a rework of EXPEDITION, with a focus on being more vanilla+, modular, and slimming down the stuff I found unnecessary to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly experience.  
Archived 27/08/2023.  
Reason: Not interested in maintaining. Super Simple S.T.A.L.K.E.R. kinda usurps this list.
- [Old World Addon Plus](./old-world-addon-plus)
> A vanilla+ modlist for the Old World Addon mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly.  
Archived 27/08/2023.  
Reason: Not interested in maintaining. Super Simple S.T.A.L.K.E.R. kinda usurps this list.

### Archived Guides
- [Viva New Wastelands](./vnv-to-ttw)
> A guide to convert [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) to Tale of Two Wastelands.  
Archived 11/11/2023.  
Reason: Wasteland Survival Guide is likely a better guide to follow.
- [HSJ Lists](./hsj)
> Small lists of mods that require another modlist (your own or someone else's) to setup. I usually use these with vanilla+ modlists because there's some part of the game I still dislike. *Highly subjective, modular, and lightweight*.  
Archived 11/11/2023.  
Reason: These little collection of mods seemed useless to keep updated.
- [G.A.M.M.A. Tedium Removal](./gamma-tedium-removal)
> A simple "enable this, disable this" guide to remove G.A.M.M.A.'s tedium. Feels good to have fun again.  
Archived 08/12/2023.  
Reason: I no longer enjoy playing G.A.M.M.A. or "hardcore" S.T.A.L.K.E.R., for anyone else like me, I recommend NOMAD. The modlist can be found on Reddit.
- [G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS For Escape From Pripyat](./gamma-bhs-for-efp)
> Adds G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS into Escape From Pripyat, I liked it more.  
Archived 08/12/2023.  
Reason: I no longer enjoy playing Escape From Pripyat or "hardcore" S.T.A.L.K.E.R., for anyone else like me, I recommend NOMAD. The modlist can be found on Reddit.
- [Modlist Additions](./modlist-additions)
> Personal modlist additions that aim that are my preferred way to play some games.  
Archived 28/11/2024.  
Pointless.
- [PAYDAY 2 Build Guides (WIP)](./pd2-build-starts)
> Links to build starts for PAYDAY 2 perk decks.  
Archives 29/11/2024.  
I do not play PAYDAY 2 as much as I used to and do not have the energy to maintain this.

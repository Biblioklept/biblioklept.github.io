### Archived Modlists

- [The Midnight Ride Extended](./tmr-extended)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride that aim to improve the user experience further with some more subjective mods. Essentially it removes my personal gripes from the game while adding minimal content.
- [The Midnight Ride WARS](./tmr-wars)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride to install the WARS mod (and some of its sub-mods) on top of it.

### Archived Guides

- [Viva New Wastelands](./vnv-to-ttw)
> A guide to convert [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) to Tale of Two Wastelands.
- [HSJ Lists](./hsj)
> Small lists of mods that require another modlist (your own or someone else's) to setup. I usually use these with vanilla+ modlists because there's some part of the game I still dislike. *Highly subjective, modular, and lightweight*.

### Archived Modlists

- [The Midnight Ride Extended](./tmr-extended)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride that aim to improve the user experience further with some more subjective mods. Essentially it removes my personal gripes from the game while adding minimal content. Archived 11/11/2023.
- [The Midnight Ride WARS](./tmr-wars)
> A list of mods for The Midnight Ride to install the WARS mod (and some of its sub-mods) on top of it. Archived 11/11/2023.

### Archived Guides

- [Viva New Wastelands](./vnv-to-ttw)
> A guide to convert [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com) to Tale of Two Wastelands. Archived 11/11/2023.
- [HSJ Lists](./hsj)
> Small lists of mods that require another modlist (your own or someone else's) to setup. I usually use these with vanilla+ modlists because there's some part of the game I still dislike. *Highly subjective, modular, and lightweight*. Archived 11/11/2023.
- [G.A.M.M.A. Tedium Removal](./gamma-tedium-removal)
> A simple "enable this, disable this" guide to remove G.A.M.M.A.'s tedium. Feels good to have fun again. Archived 08/12/2023.
- [G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS For Escape From Pripyat](./gamma-bhs-for-efp)
> Adds G.A.M.M.A.'s BHS into Escape From Pripyat, I liked it more. Archived 08/12/2023.

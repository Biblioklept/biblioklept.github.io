This addon darken the bright lines and background of the Svarog and Veles detector in order to make them usable when you activate your NVG

Using Gimp "Shadows-Highlights" Color tool, i just darkened the part of the texture for both Svarog and Veles that is responsible for the screen display.
This remove the overbright problem when you're using those devices when you have NVG activated.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

- SRAP2 for CotZ is a totally different addon from Full Weapon Reanimation for CotZ that can be found there :
https://www.moddb.com/mods/doctorx-call-of-the-zone/addons/fwr-cotz
- SRAP2 for CotZ does not touch any particles , sounds or textures (unlike its ancestors, reason is i wanted it being ONLY an animation replacement).
- SRAP2 for CotZ does not alter the weapons and ammo stats.
- SRAP2 for CotZ does not replace the weapons textures and does not add new weapons, it only use the default CotZ weapons and textures
- SRAP2 for CotZ does not replace the knife animations, simply because i prefer the original animation over the replacement.


-------------
COMPATIBILITY
-------------
Obviously SRAP2 for CotZ is not compatible with any other weapon packs (as they usually feature their own animations and weapons ltx)
SRAP2 will not be compatible with any addon that replace the same files of course.

As SRAP2 for CotZ does not replace any texture, it is fully compatible with addons that replace weapons textures, like this one

And the MISERY-like rusted weapon textures found in this one :

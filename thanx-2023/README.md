# Thanks for 2023

### To everyone:
While 2023 is a year I mostly hated (as is typical with the later I get into my life), you all made getting through the year worth it. The people here and onward are the reason I keep living and actively pursue the life I currently have. If you're not on this list, for whatever reason, whether it's my poor memory, we stopped talking, or we talked later in the future, just past the New Year, I just want to say thank you for the good times and the memories. As I'm writing this, the fireworks are going off, so I doubt I'll be able to put everything out, but just know you all have my deepest thanks.

### To Alex H.:
Funny dude and a great friend. We don't really talk a lot outside of playing video games together, but I wish we did. You're a pretty good dude to have discussions with about art and video games, and you're just a good friend overall.

### To Alex M.:
One of the few people I have in Indiana and one of the most intelligent people I know. You joke a lot, but deep down, you're a really caring guy when it matters, and it's great to have a friend to lean on and know like the back of my hand. I'm happy to have known you for the past six years.

### To Christian:
Talking, like with some of the friends on this list, has slowed down over the following years for a multitude of reasons. Past that slow communication, you manage to be one of the happiest guys in the room and one of the funniest. You're a great person to talk to, and you manage to keep your head up even through some deep shit.

### To Fisher:
You're one of the best people to talk with, and I've had some of my best discussions of art and general life with you. I look forward to starting a duo or a band sometime, if the time ever finds us. The intelligence, talent, and charm you have are great, and 2023 has been unfairly kind to you. I can only hope for better future years.

### To Jackson:
Arguably one of the nicest people I've met and one of the most supportive. You helped me through hunger and shitty Christmases, and you have my greatest gratitude for it. I like to make a lot of jokes, but I'm happy with the way your life is going so far, and I hope life gets better from here.

### To Jacob:
Yet another person that communication has slowed down with, but you've been a super funny and nice dude that got me through that transitional period where I didn't have very many friends. I've had a lot of good gaming memories with you, and I hope to have more.

### To James:
We banter a lot, but I know you care about the people you know deep down. You're incredibly funny and focused on whatever goal you set your mind to, and it's great to see that in a world where it's easy to get lazy.

### To Jelani:
It's been a long time since we've talked a lot, but I still miss it. You were there for me in some of my worst years and stopped me from doing something stupid to myself, and you have my deepest thanks for that. You're incredibly funny, motivated, and just a great person overall. I regret not knowing you sooner.

### To Kachi:
A great musician and a greater friend, seriously, man, your stuff rocks. Stick with it, and I believe you'll make it out of the indie stage. I still remember the song you wrote for me, and it means a lot. It's not always easy to get a one-on-one with you, but the few times I have, you've been a really chill dude and a solid person to talk to.

### To Luke:
Thanks for being the reason for me being able to talk to Fisher and Nick; without you three, school would've been a bigger hell than it already was. While we have our disputes, we can always be reasonable, agree to disagree, and never hold each other in a negative light.

### To Nick:
You are the reason I got back into cars and found them even remotely interesting again. The passion you put into your work is unmatched and truly inspiring. If the passion you currently carry for cars follows you throughout the rest of your life, you'll have a great life ahead of you.

### To Mathze:
Super funny, relatable, and nice. I haven't known you for too long, so I can't say much, but I feel like we're going to be talking for a long time. Incredibly focused and caring, talking with you has been a blast, and I've enjoyed it immensely so far.

# Better Windows
![Windows](https://icon-library.com/images/windows-10-logo-icon/windows-10-logo-icon-16.jpg)

Debloating Windows can free up wasted System resources and can improve performance in games and what not for low end PCs. But that doesn't mean high-end PCs won't get any benefits. Debloating will make Windows more Private since you remove and disable all the telemetry and what not that is constantly running sending data to Microsoft. Another benefit is less clutter and more customization, since debloating removes all Windows UWP apps (e.g Groove Music, Movie Editor, and etc.) this gives space to use way better alternatives and remove apps you never use. Overall, whether you have a low end or high end PC, its def worth debloating windows as it will make the experience using Windows smoother and better.

# Overview
There are two methods to make windows better first method being installing LTSC which is heavily debloated Windows ISO or Second Method which is running debloating scripts on existing Windows Install.

I would recommend first method as you will run into less issues afterwards but if you don't feel confident enough reinstalling your OS then second method is your best bet.

If you don't know how to use the certain tools listed (e.g NVCleaninstall, CTT Debloat, and etc.) there is a section called `"How to Use Tools"` section at the end.

#### Before We Start
>	Just in case, make a restore point of your windows before debloating. In case something happens to windows after a few weeks passes. Usually windows updates will try undo the debloats but will instead cause itself to break.

## For Pro Gamers
If you planning on gaming only on your device and nothing else then instead of LTSC, use AtlasOS a custom Windows ISO for gamers.
>	AtlasOS prioritizes performance/response over convenience and ease of use. There will be many useful features or stuff removed. Best not use this as a Daily Driver OS.
